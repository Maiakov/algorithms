Sort an array of size n containing integers between 1 and K, given a temporary scratch integer
array of size K.

Solution:
1) Call countNumbersOccurrences. Use every element as index-1
2) Traverse by countNumbersOccurrences array and create inner cycle 
            for (int j = 0; j < numbersOccurrences[i] && index < bound; j++) {
                result[index++] = i + 1;
            }
