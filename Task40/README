Write a routine to draw a circle (x ** 2 + y ** 2 = r ** 2) without making use of any floating point computations at all.

Solution : use Bresenham's algorithm

Calculate delta before choosing next dot. 

Start delta = 3 - 2 * radius;
Horithontal delta = oldDelta + 4 * x + 6; 
Vertical delta = oldDelta + 4 * (x - y) + 10;
